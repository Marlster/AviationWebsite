Hi {{ user.username }},

Thank you for signing up to the gliding session on {{signup.session.date}}!

We will be meeting outside the union at 7am. 

Please bring your logbook (if you have one), sunglasses (if it's sunny) and either pack a lunch or bring some money for the cafe. 

Make sure to check your email for updates and if you have any questions, feel free to contact us!

Regards,

Marley
