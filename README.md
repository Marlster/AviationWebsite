The Aviation Society Website
=======

## Repo Info

This is a website built for the St Andrews Aviation Society.
It allows members to sign up to gliding sessions and has information about gliding and other society activities.
It is built using html5/css3/js for frontend work, python with django for the backend and sqlite for the database.

## Prerequisites

To improve this website, you will need to have installed:

  * Python 3.7.2: [download python here][py]
  * Django 2.1.2: [download django here][dj]
  * A suitable text editor or IDE (EG: Sublime or Visual Studio)

  [py]: https://www.python.org/downloads/
  [dj]: https://www.djangoproject.com/download/

## Installing

  1. In the console, navigate to a folder that you want to install the project in
  2. Enter 'git clone https://github.com/Marlster/AviationWebsite.git' into the console
  3. Cd to the highest-level 'AviationSite' Folder (not the 'AviationSite' folder inside it)
  4. Type 'python manage.py runserver' to run the django test server
  5. You should then be able to access the website via the localhost IP address (127.0.0.1:8000)

## Testing

There are currently no tests. This will definitely change very soon!
